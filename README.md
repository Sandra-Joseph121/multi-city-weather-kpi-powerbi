This project presents a Live Weather KPI Dashboard built to analyze and visualize real-time weather data across 5+ major cities.

The dashboard transforms raw weather data into meaningful Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help users monitor temperature trends, humidity levels, wind speed variations, and overall climate comparisons between cities.

It demonstrates skills in:

Data modeling

KPI development

Real-time data handling

Data visualization

Business intelligence reporting
